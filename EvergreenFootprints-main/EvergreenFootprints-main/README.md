# Evergreen-Footprints: Curbing the Carbon

**Team Members:** Amisha Lalwani, V. Nihalmai, Sakshi, Tushar Shukla

Welcome to Evergreen-Footprints! This project is the culmination of our team's hard work during the IIIT-Vadodara Hackathon, where we embarked on our first journey into web development. Our main objective was to create a functional website that raises awareness about carbon footprints and helps users estimate their own carbon emissions.

## Project Overview

Evergreen-Footprints aims to provide users with an interactive platform to calculate their carbon footprints and learn about the impact of their daily activities on the environment. While it may not be a fully accurate carbon footprint calculator, it serves as a valuable educational tool and a starting point for users to become more environmentally conscious.

## Features

- **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: An easy-to-use tool for estimating the carbon emissions based on user input.
- **Educational Content**: Information and tips on how to reduce your carbon footprint.
- **Real-Time Data**: Utilizes Firebase for a real-time database to manage user data efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Firebase Real-Time Database
